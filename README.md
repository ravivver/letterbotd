# üé¨ Letterboxd Discord Bot

A full-featured Discord bot developed in Node.js that integrates Letterboxd functionalities directly into your servers!

This bot allows users to link their Letterboxd profiles and share their activity, stats, reviews, favorite films, and even compare their taste with other server members.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

This project uses **web scraping** to collect data from the Letterboxd platform. This technical choice is due to the fact that Letterboxd **does not provide an easily accessible public API**. To use the official API, you must submit a formal application and be approved, which can be a lengthy and challenging process for study projects and small-scale development.

Using web scraping offers the flexibility to extract necessary information directly from visible HTML pages, allowing the desired features to be implemented, although it may require maintenance if the structure of the Letterboxd site changes.

## ‚ú® Main Features

- **Comprehensive Search:** Search for movies and directors with the `/search` command.
- **Profile Interaction:** View stats, favorites, diary entries, and reviews with the `/profile`, `/favorites`, `/diary`, and `/review` commands.
- **Activity Analysis:** Check if someone has already watched a movie using `/checkfilm`.
- **Social Features:** Compare films in common between two users with `/compare` and get random watchlist suggestions with `/hint`.
- **Server Ranking:** Discover the most popular films on the server using `/top`!
- **Image Generation:** Create custom poster grids using the `/favorites` and `/likesgrid` commands.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **discord.js v14+** (Slash Commands, Buttons, Select Menus, Embeds)
- **axios** & **cheerio** for web scraping Letterboxd data
- **TMDB API** for data enrichment (posters, synopses, directors)
- **sharp** for image processing
- **sqlite3** for persistent data storage (server ranking)
